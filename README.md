## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I've learned a lot about flexbox and its properties, such as align-self, flex-grow. Now I feel like I have a deeper understanding of the position property, because I had to make the success page overlay the main one. Also this is the project in which I've touched a bit of transitions, because I had to use them to make the button change animations when the mouse hovered over it.
